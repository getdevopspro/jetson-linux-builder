# üöÄ NVIDIA Jetson Builder Container Image

A ready-to-use container image for flashing and customizing NVIDIA Jetson devices using the official L4T release packages.

This image simplifies the flashing process by bundling:

* The **Jetson Linux release package** for a specified L4T version.
* Essential tools and dependencies required to flash and customize Jetson boards.
* A containerized, reproducible environment following NVIDIA's official flashing guide.
* A foundation for CI/CD pipelines and automation of Jetson device customization.

Perfect for robotics engineers and embedded developers working with **Jetson Nano**, **Xavier**, **Orin**, and other Jetson boards.

## üß∞ Features

* Downloads and unpacks the official **Jetson Linux L4T release package**.
* Includes all dependencies to run `l4t_flash_prerequisites.sh`.
* Suitable for scripting and automation in CI/CD or development pipelines.
* Supports container-based development without polluting your host system.

**IMPORTANT: Changes inside the container are not persistent.**

## üîß Usage
Run the container to access a consistent Jetson flashing environment with all necessary tools and dependencies preinstalled. You can use it interactively or within automation pipelines.

### Example: Enter the Container With Jetson Release Workspace
This will create a container with the Jetson Release contents available at `/workspace` (default folder). Inside the container, you can run the `./flash.sh` script and other tools as needed.

```bash
The container will be removed after exiting.
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --privileged \
  --network host \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb/ \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  ghcr.io/getdevopspro/jetson-linux-builder:36.4.3
```

### Example: Create a Sample RootFS
This will create a minimal sample rootfs from L4t scripts. It will be saved at `.shared/sample_fs-jammy-minimal.tbz2` of the current directory.
```bash
mkdir -p .shared
docker run --rm \
        --name build-rootfs-36.4.3-minimal \
        --privileged \
        --network host \
        -v /var/home/job/mydata/myrepos/jetson-linux-rootfs/.shared:/workspace/shared \
        --workdir /workspace/tools/samplefs \
        --platform linux/amd64 \
        ghcr.io/getdevopspro/jetson-linux-builder:36.4.3 bash -xc \
                'sed -i "s@arch | grep .*@arch | grep \"$(arch)\")\"@" nv_build_samplefs.sh; \
                sudo bash -x ./nv_build_samplefs.sh \
                --abi aarch64 \
                --distro ubuntu \
                --flavor minimal \
                --version jammy; \
                chown 1000 sample_fs.tbz2; \
                mv sample_fs.tbz2 /workspace/shared/sample_fs-jammy-minimal.tbz2'
```
